# Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple 2-player Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a classic game that challenges players to strategically place their marks (X or O) in a 3x3 grid with the objective of getting three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

# Features

Two players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their marks (X or O).
